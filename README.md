# Wordle 


## Overview

This repo contains two wordle clones - normal Wordle, and Wordle in easy mode. Normal wordle will keep track of which spaces in the word are known, which letters must be in the word, and which must not be in the word. The second
Wordle clone will be in "Easy mode" – and will tell you how many possible words are left, and provide you with a sample of possible words after each guess. 


## Brief History

The game Wordle has a short and interesting history, originally designed in 2013 as a letter-based copy of the color-matching game Mastermind, Wordle quickly became popular during the Covid-19 lock downs of 2020 and 2021. As of now, Wordle is owned by the New York Times, and can be played for free online at https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html


## Game Rules

The game of Wordle is simple to play. In each game a 5 letter English word is chosen. The player gets six attempts to guess this five letter word. Each guess is limited to be a real word (I.E. the game only accepts real words as guesses, typing not-a-word will not cost a guess) After each guess the player is given a clue as feedback. This clue will present the
players last guess with colors annotating each letter

1. Green – a letter is green to indicate the secret word has the same letter in this position
as the guess

2. Yellow – a letter is yellow to indicate that the secret word contains this letter, but not
at this position

3. Grey – a letter is typically grey to indicate that the word does not contain this letter.
